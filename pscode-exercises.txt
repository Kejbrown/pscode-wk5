// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Num 1 + Num 2 = NumSum 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

check the number and run it through a if else statement. If the num is divisible by 2, else odd. 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a. print i = 1 to 5
b. sum = sum + i 
average = sum /5
C. if else statement if the number is smaller then the smallest number then = min 
if else statment if number is larger than the largest number = max
d. 
print("The average is "average", average)
print("The smallest number is "min", smallest)
print("The largest number is "max", largest)
